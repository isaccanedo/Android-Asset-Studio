# The Android Asset Studio is no longer maintained. Please use [icon.kitchen](https://icon.kitchen) or the asset creation tools built into Android Studio

A web-based set of tools for generating graphics and other assets that would eventually be in an Android application's res/ directory.

Currently available asset generators are for:

- Launcher icons
- Action bar icons
- Notification icons
- Generic square icons
- Simple nine-patches

## Building the tool

To build, ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed, and run:

    $ npm install

Once dependencies are installed, run it:

    $ npm start
